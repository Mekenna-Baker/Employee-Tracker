# Employee Tracker


The Employee Tracker is a command-line application designed to manage a company's employee database. This project allows business owners and managers to effortlessly organize and track the various departments, roles, and employees within their organization.

Built using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL, this project serves as a practical demonstration of my newly acquired PostgreSQL skills. By developing this application, I have gained hands-on experience in creating and managing relational databases, writing SQL queries, and integrating PostgreSQL with Node.js.
